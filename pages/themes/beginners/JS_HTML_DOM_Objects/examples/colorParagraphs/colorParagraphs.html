            <h3>Hey You (2011 Remastered Version)</h3>
            <p>Hey you out there in the cold<br>
                Getting lonely getting old<br>
                Can you feel me?<br>
                Hey you standing in the aisles<br>
                With itchy feet and fading smiles<br>
                Can you feel me?<br>
                Hey you don't help them to bury the light<br>
                Don't give in without a fight</p>
            <p>Hey you out there on your own<br>
                Sitting naked by the phone<br>
                Would you touch me?<br>
                Hey you with you ear against the wall<br>
                Waiting for someone to call out<br>
                Would you touch me?<br>
                Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?<br>
                Open your heart, I'm coming home</p>
            <p>But it was only fantasy<br>
                The wall was too high<br>
                As you can see<br>
                No matter how he tried<br>
                He could not break free<br>
                And the worms ate into his brain</p>
            <p>Hey you, out there on the road<br>
                Always doing what you're told<br>
                Can you help me?<br>
                Hey you, out there beyond the wall<br>
                Breaking bottles in the hall<br>
                Can you help me?<br>
                Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all<br>
                Together we stand, divided we fall</p>

            <h3>Charlotte Sometimes</h3>
                <p>All the faces<br>
                All the voices blur<br>
                Change to one face<br>
                Change to one voice<br>
                Prepare yourself for bed<br>
                The light seems bright<br>
                And glares on white walls<br>
                All the sounds of<br>
                Charlotte sometimes<br>
                Into the night with<br>
                Charlotte sometimes</p>
                <p>Night after night she lay alone in bed<br>
                Her eyes so open to the dark<br>
                The streets all looked so strange<br>
                They seemed so far away<br>
                But Charlotte did not cry</p>
                <p>The people seemed so close<br>
                Playing expressionless games<br>
                The people seemed so close<br>
                So many other names</p>
                <p>Sometimes I'm dreaming<br>
                Where all the other people dance<br>
                Sometimes I'm dreaming<br>
                Charlotte sometimes<br>
                Sometimes I'm dreaming<br>
                Expressionless the trance<br>
                Sometimes I'm dreaming<br>
                So many different names<br>
                Sometimes I'm dreaming<br>
                The sounds all stay the same<br>
                Sometimes I'm dreaming<br>
                She hopes to open shadowed eyes<br>
                On a different world<br>
                Come to me scared princess<br>
                Charlotte sometimes</p>
                <p>On that bleak track<br>
                (see the sun is gone again)<br>
                The tears were pouring down her face<br>
                She was crying and crying for a girl<br>
                Who died so many years before</p>
                <p>Sometimes I dream<br>
                Where all the other people dance<br>
                Sometimes I dream<br>
                Charlotte sometimes<br>
                Sometimes I dream<br>
                The sounds all stay the same<br>
                Sometimes I'm dreaming<br>
                There are so many different names<br>
                Sometimes I dream<br>
                Sometimes I dream</p>
                <p>Charlotte sometimes crying for herself<br>
                Charlotte sometimes dreams a wall around herself<br>
                But it's always with love<br>
                With so much love it looks like<br>
                Everything else<br>
                Of Charlotte sometimes<br>
                So far away<br>
                Glass sealed and pretty<br>
                Charlotte sometimes</p>
